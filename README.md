Log Road
===========
### Overview
Log Road models logging roads based on existing OSM street data, forest stands, and a cost surface.

####Input

OSM street data | Forest Stands | Cost Surface
--- | --- | ---
OSM | Shapefile (EPSG2857) | GeoTIFF (EPSG32610)

####Process

* Buffer from the stands are created based on a specified skidding distance.
* Fishnet grid covering the buffer extent is created.
* Dictionary is created. For each grid cell the intersecting buffers are recorderd: `{GridCellID:[BufferID1,BufferID2,...]}`
* OSM data are downloaded and get burned into the Cost Surface
* Cost Surface gets updated: Areas outside of the stands are more expensive, areas at the boundary of the stands are less expensive
* Buffers intersecting with OSM streets are removed from the dicitionary. 
* Loop over Dictionary:
    * Cell from dictionary with most intersecting buffers is selected.
    * New road from cell to closest road is created.
    * Buffers intersecting with new road are removed from the dicitionary. 
* New roads are written to output shapefile.
